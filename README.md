# Projet 7 :

**_Description :_**

The goal of this project is to provide a website (availabe at https://p7papybot.herokuapp.com/ ) where you can ask some question to Papy Bot about a famous place and where to find it.  
Just fill the blank with your question.
For exemple : "S'il te plait Papy Bot, je voudrais savoir l'adresse d'Openclassrooms".  
Then Papy Bot will answer and give you the street where is located "Openclassrooms" with a small description, then a map from Google and the link to wikipedia for the street it self.  

This is a responsive website so feel free to use it on all your devices like laptop, smartphone etc...  

Have fun !
